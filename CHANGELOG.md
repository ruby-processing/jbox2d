### v0.1.1

Make common classes avaiable directly, expose sketch eight.

### v0.1.0

Now require 'pbox2d' matches gem name, refactor java methods by removing unnecessary get/set/pixel. Also prefer to world and to processing. Adjust examples, bump version to denote significant change.


### v0.0.1

First release, works but require name 'box2d' doesn't match gem name it is confusing
